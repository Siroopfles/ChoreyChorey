## üöÄ General UI/UX & Visual Polish

- Implement smooth, interruptible animations on all state changes.
- Add subtle hover effects to all interactive elements (buttons, links, cards).
- Improve focus states (`focus-visible`) for all interactive elements for better accessibility.
- Create a consistent 'empty state' component for all lists (projects, tasks, notifications).
- Create a consistent 'loading state' component (skeleton) for all data-fetching components.
- Refine the color palette for better contrast ratios, especially for muted text.
- Introduce a 'glassmorphism' effect for dialogs and popovers for a more modern feel.
- Animate the entry of new items into lists (e.g., a new task appearing on the board).
- Add a subtle parallax scroll effect to the landing page hero image.
- Implement a 'confetti' animation when a user completes a significant task or achievement.
- Standardize the iconography across the entire application for consistency.
- Improve the layout of the user profile page to better showcase stats and achievements.
- Refine the typography hierarchy for better readability.
- Add a "zen mode" that hides all non-essential UI elements for deep focus on the current task.
- Ensure all dialogs are dismissible by pressing the 'Escape' key.
- Add a visual indicator for links that open in a new tab.
